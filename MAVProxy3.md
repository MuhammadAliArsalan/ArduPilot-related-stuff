## What are Rally Points?

Normally, when a drone (Plane or Copter) enters Return to Launch (RTL) mode—like when it loses signal, battery is low, or a failsafe triggers—it goes back to the Home point, which is usually the takeoff location.

*Problem:* Sometimes going straight back to Home is not safe or practical:

* Home could be above people, buildings, or restricted areas.
* The drone may be far away, and going all the way back is inefficient or risky.

### Solution: Rally Points

Rally Points are predefined safe locations where the drone can go instead of Home.

* If RTL is triggered and Rally Points exist, the drone will:
  * Go to the closest Rally Point first.
  * Plane: loiters there (hovers or circles).
  * Copter: lands automatically at the Rally Point.

Think of Rally Points like emergency safe landing zones for your drone.
