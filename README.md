# 🛩️ Welcome to the Drone Automation Repository

Welcome to the world of **drones and autonomous flight control!**  
This repository is your complete learning and experimentation space for working with **ArduPilot** and its powerful ecosystem.

Here, you’ll explore and practice how to automate, control, and monitor drones using multiple tools and scripting interfaces, including:

- 🧭 **MAVProxy** — the command-line ground control station for ArduPilot  
- 🐍 **PyMAVLink** — Python API for communicating directly with the autopilot  
- ⚙️ **DroneKit** — high-level Python framework for mission scripting and telemetry  
- 🧩 **Lua Scripting** — onboard scripts for real-time autopilot logic and behaviors  

Each section in this repository provides **hands-on examples**, **real MAVProxy commands**, and **parameter configurations** you can test in SITL (Software-In-The-Loop) simulation or real hardware.

Whether you're a **student**, **researcher**, or **developer** interested in UAVs, this repo will help you:
- Understand **ArduPilot internals**
- Learn **autonomous mission control**
- Implement **custom logic and geofencing**
- Build your own **smart drone automation workflows**

---
> 🚀 **Get ready to take off!**  
> From basic command-line control to advanced autonomous scripts — you’ll learn how to turn code into flight.
